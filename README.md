# TwitchApp

C# App to show twitch stream previews, and launch selected stream quality in MPC-HC

This was created to make it easier to follow the many streams of Dota2's The International. I wanted to learn more about C#, WPF and experiment with the Twitch API, so this was the result.

There are undoubtedly many bugs, and only the favorites tab actually does anything. so use at your own risk.
